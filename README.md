# Bank-Term-Deposit-Prediction
This project predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit using the Bank Marketing dataset. It includes data cleaning, feature encoding, outlier handling, age binning, and training a Random Forest model. The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

A machine learning-based solution designed to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit. Built using Python and Scikit-learn, this project performs end-to-end data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation using a real-world marketing dataset from a Portuguese bank.


## 📌 Introduction

This project helps financial institutions identify clients who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. By analyzing past marketing campaign data, a Random Forest classifier is trained to predict customer response based on demographic and interaction features.


## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Handle missing values using mode
- ✅ Detect and handle outliers using IQR
- ✅ One-hot encode categorical variables
- ✅ Categorize age into groups (Youth, Adult, Senior)
- ✅ Train a `RandomForestClassifier`
- ✅ Evaluate with:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- ✅ Display top feature importances

## ⚙ Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load `bank-full.csv` into a DataFrame.
   
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Fill missing values  
   - Encode target and categorical columns  
   - Create `AgeGroup` bins  
   - Handle outliers in `balance` and clip `duration` extremes  
   - Drop unnecessary columns (`pdays`, `previous`)

3. **Feature Preparation**  
   - One-hot encoding for categorical data  
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
   - Split into train-test sets

4. **Modeling**  
   - Train a `RandomForestClassifier` on the processed data

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Compute accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  
   - Extract and rank feature importances


## 📈 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 90.39%  
- **Classification Report**:
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-score for both classes
- **Confusion Matrix**:
